    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my homepage, the source of all my creative content, design masterpieces and innovative anomalies. Here you will find an abundance of never-before-seen material that has yet to reach the attention of the masses. An underground plethora of cutting-edge invention. You have never before experienced anything on the magnitude of what lies before you.</p>
    <p>For those who would delve onward, I leave you one last parting warning: leave now and never return. Mortal eyes can only behold so much beauty before the entirty of our being is irreversibly consumed by its grandeur. For the sake of your loved ones, your colleagues, or perhaps any canine companions who would miss you dearly, do not continue.</p>
    <p>Should you choose to ignore my plea, than the paths through this terrifyingly glorious site may be located in the above header or on either side bar. Good luck human.</p>
